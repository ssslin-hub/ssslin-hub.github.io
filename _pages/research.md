## Generalization of DeGroot Model
<div style="text-align: right"> Mentor: Dr. Alan Scheller-Wolf </div>
<div style="text-align: right"> Aug. 2024 - Present </div>
* Investigate the generalization of DeGroot model in social networks, applying techniques in Information Theory and Operations Research

## Generalization of Helly's Theorem ([NYC Discrete Math REU Program](https://geometrynyc.wixsite.com/home/combinatorics-reu))
<div style="text-align: right"> Mentor: Dr. Pablo Soberón </div>
<div style="text-align: right"> June 2024 - Aug. 2024 </div>
* Studied Discrete Geometry and Combinatorial topology, with a focus on Helly’s theorem and Ham sandwich theorem
* Proved an upperbound of the fractional Helly number for any family \\(\mathcal F\\) of linear partitions in the \\(n\\)
  dimensional projective space by bounding the dual VC-dimension of \\(\mathcal F\\)


## Packing and Covering Problem
<div style="text-align: right"> Mentor: Dr. David Offner </div>
<div style="text-align: right"> Gus. 2023 - May 2024 </div>
* Conducted research on packing, covering and tiling for various integer sets; explored the applications
in integer programming
* Proved the packing densities of sets of four integers is \\(\frac{1}{7}\\) , achieved by \\({0, 1, 4, 7}\\)

## Collapsibility Thresholds for Geometric Complexes on Spheres
<div style="text-align: right"> Mentor: Dr. Andrew Newman </div>
<div style="text-align: right"> May 2023 - Dec. 2023 </div>
* Conducted research on random simplicial complexes; studied their geometric and topological
properties; explored their applications in stochastic topology and topological data analysis
* Co-authored a paper about the threshold of \\(r\\) for the \\(k\\)-collapsibility of a uniformly and randomly
distributed *Vietoris Rips* complex on a \\(d\\)-sphere with \\(n\\) points and distance parameter \\(r\\)
