* Studied Discrete Geometry and Combinatorial topology, with a focus on Helly’s theorem and Ham sandwich theorem.
* Proved an upper bound of the fractional Helly number for any family \(\mathcal{F}\) of linear partitions in the \(n\)-dimensional projective space by bounding the dual VC-dimension of \(\mathcal{F}\).

**Abstract:** Helly's theorem, along with its variations, has been extensively studied, with the fractional version being noteworthy. The fractional Helly's theorem (Katchalski, Liu, 1979) states that in a finite family \(\mathcal{F}\) of convex sets in \(\mathbb{R}^d\), if at least some fraction of the total possible \((d+1)\)-tuples in \(\mathcal{F}\) intersect, then there must be at least some other fraction of all sets in \(\mathcal{F}\) that intersect. It has been proven that \(d+1\) is the fractional Helly number for convex sets in \(\mathbb{R}^d\). While this focuses on convex sets, our research studies the fractional version of Helly's theorem for linear partitions, defined as unions of subspaces that are in general position.

Helly's theorem for linear partitions (Arocha, Bracho, Montejano, 2007) states that in a finite family \(\mathcal{A}\) of linear partitions in \(\mathbb{P}^n\), if every \(\lfloor {\frac{3(n+1)}{2}} \rfloor\) or fewer linear partitions in \(\mathcal{A}\) have a non-empty intersection, then all of them do. We upper bound the dual VC dimension of any finite family of linear partitions in \(\mathbb{P}^n\) by \(2^{n+1}-1\). Thus, by the theorem of fractional Helly for bounded VC-dimension (Matoušek, 2004), we conclude that the fractional Helly number of any finite family of linear partitions in \(\mathbb{P}^n\) is upper bounded by \(2^{n+1}\).

* Conducted research on random simplicial complexes; studied their geometric and topological properties; explored their applications in stochastic topology and topological data analysis.
* Co-authored a paper about the threshold of \(r\) for the \(k\)-collapsibility of a uniformly and randomly distributed *Vietoris Rips* complex on a \(d\)-sphere with \(n\) points and distance parameter \(r\).

**Abstract:** We study the Vietoris–Rips complex formed on \(n\) points selected uniformly at random from the \(d\)-sphere \(S^d\) to establish collapsibility results; that is, results about when it is possible to reduce the dimension of the complex without changing critical topological properties. On \(S^1\), we proved a coarse threshold for the random complex to be \(1\)-collapsible, and for \(S^d\) where \(d \geq 2\), we proved coarse thresholds for \(k\)-collapsibility for all \(k\).
