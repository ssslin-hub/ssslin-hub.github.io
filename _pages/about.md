I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.cmu.edu/math/index.html) at Carnegie Mellon University. I also have two minors in Computer Science and Statistics, respecitvely.

My research interests are broadly Combinatorics, Applied Math, and Operations Research.

I am in the process of applying to graduate programs for Fall 2024, with a primary focus on Mathematics and Operations Research.
